# jsnlog.AspNet5Demo
Shows JavaScript logging in a simple ASP.NET Core application

**Important**

ASP.NET Core does not automatically restore NuGet packages. To ensure all NuGet packages are loaded, run "dotnet restore" from the command line in the directory where you placed this demo site.

```
cd ...directory with AspNet5Demo...
dotnet restore

```

You will see some error messages. You can ignore those.
